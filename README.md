# 1. Introduction
This dashboard focuses on analyzing the tariff relationships between the United States and other countries. It highlights the imbalance between how much the USA is taxed (tariff to USA) compared to how much the USA taxes others (reciprocal tariffs). It brings attention to global trade inequalities, offering insight into the bilateral tariff gaps with each country.

# 2. Purpose & Objective
Purpose:
To provide a clear, visual understanding of the tariff imbalances the USA faces in international trade.

Objectives:
Measure the total tariffs imposed on the USA by different countries.

Compare these with the tariffs imposed by the USA on those same countries.

Calculate the Tariff Gap to highlight unfair trade practices.

Identify countries with high differentials for focused policy reviews.

# 3. Audience & Context
Intended Audience:
Trade policy makers and government officials

International trade economists

Diplomats and commerce ministers

Business and logistics analysts

Context:
As global trade becomes more competitive, understanding tariff reciprocity is crucial. This dashboard supports data-driven policy negotiation and helps identify where corrective measures might be required in trade agreements.

# 4. Data Source & Scope
Data Source:
International trade data aggregated from global customs and tariff reports.

Scope Includes:
30+ countries

Tariff to USA: Tariffs other countries impose on American exports

Reciprocal Tariff: Tariffs the USA imposes on imports from those countries

Timeframe: Cumulative and comparative — not specific to a single year

Regions Covered: Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia

# 5. Dashboard Overview
Main Metrics (Top Center):
Tariff to USA: 20.63

Reciprocal Tariff: 10.46

Tariff Gap: 10.17 (Total disparity)

Visual Components:
Left Bar Chart: Top countries imposing high tariffs on USA (e.g., Vietnam, Syria, Madagascar)

Scatter Plot: Bilateral reciprocity — most dots fall below the diagonal, signaling imbalance

Map: Shows global distribution of reciprocal tariffs by country

Right Table: Country-wise tariff breakdown with differential highlighted in yellow

Interactive Element:
Visual scale bars and scrollable table allow focusing on individual country relationships

# 6. Key Insights
The total tariff burden on the USA (20.63) is almost double its reciprocal tariff (10.46)

Countries like Cambodia (0.97 vs 0.49) and Iraq (0.78 vs 0.39) show huge gaps

Top high-differential nations:

Cambodia (0.48 difference)

Guyana (0.38)

Iraq (0.39)

Bangladesh (0.37)

The scatter plot reveals that most countries are below parity—charging the USA more than they are charged

The global map indicates tariff clusters — particularly in Asia and Africa

European Union and Norway have lower differentials — indicating more balanced trade

Countries like Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Madagascar, and Mauritius appear prominently on the counter-tariff chart

# 7. Discussion Points
Trade Imbalance Reality: The USA is bearing more cost to export than it imposes for imports

Developing Nations’ Strategy: Many smaller economies protect local industries by imposing higher tariffs on USA products

Policy Gap: Lack of reciprocation suggests asymmetric trade relationships, which can be renegotiated

Impact on U.S. Exporters: American companies face higher entry costs, reducing their competitiveness abroad

Regional Trends:

Asia: Many countries show tariff gaps

Europe: More balanced relationships

Africa: Varies by country, some highly imbalanced

Outliers Need Attention: Countries with very high differentials should be flagged for trade reform

 # 8. Limitations
No Time-Series Data: The dashboard doesn’t show changes over time

No Trade Volume Context: We don’t know which tariff gaps are associated with high-volume trade

No Product Categories: There’s no breakdown by types of goods

No Revenue Impact Shown: We can’t estimate losses due to tariff differentials

Limited Countries Displayed: Only selected countries appear

No Policy Notes: There’s no explanation for why certain countries have such high or low rates

# 9. Recommendations & Future Scope
Include Volume of Trade: Combine tariff data with export/import volume for better clarity

Add Year-Wise Comparison: Track changes in tariffs across the years to spot trends

Incorporate Product Categories: Knowing which goods are taxed heavily could help in sectoral negotiations

Revenue Impact Estimation: Include a model to estimate financial impact of tariff gaps

Add Forecasting Tools: Use machine learning to predict future tariff movements or risks

Enable Country Grouping: Compare regions (e.g., ASEAN, EU, African Union)

Display Policy Status: Highlight if trade agreements (e.g., WTO, bilateral deals) are in place

# 10. Conclusion
This dashboard uncovers a critical reality — the United States faces a global tariff disadvantage. With a total gap of over 10.17 tariff points, it is evident that many countries charge significantly more to the USA than they are charged in return. While some nations maintain balanced trade tariffs, a majority exhibit non-reciprocal structures that could hurt U.S. exports and competitiveness.

By integrating additional data like trade volume, product categories, and revenue estimates, this dashboard can evolve into a powerful strategic tool for trade policymakers. It provides clear evidence that reforms, renegotiations, and fairer trade deals are needed to ensure balanced international commerce.
